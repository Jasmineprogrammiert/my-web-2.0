        <p>Hello, my name is <i><strong>Jasmine Zeng</strong></i>. I was born and raised in Mainland China. In addition to being a Marketing undergraduate at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, I am also a web developer and language enthusiast. As a person who values self-improvement and personal development to a great extent, I constantly strive to learn new skills and knowledge and aim for proficiency.</p>
        <p>My interests extend beyond academic studies to programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My first foray into web development was in late 2021. Initially, I only intended to create a website showcasing my hiking experiences and photos. However, I soon realized that I really enjoy building websites and am always eager to learn more. At the moment, I am still working on front-end, but I plan to get into backend in late 2022.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I am an avid language devotee. A language acts like a bridge that enables me to connect to people and their cultures on a deeper level. For this reason, I find it extremely fascinating. Right now, I am actively learning German and French after being fluent in English and Cantonese.</p>
        <p>Besides the above activities, I also enjoy hiking, visiting history and art museums, and exploring local neighborhoods for their food and cultures.</p>

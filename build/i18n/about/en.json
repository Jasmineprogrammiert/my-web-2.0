    "about-me": "About me",
    "about-1": "Hello, my name is <i><strong>Jasmine Zeng</strong></i>. I'm a software engineer and marketing undergrad based in Hong Kong. With a restless curiosity and an independent mind, I believe that anything is possible with action, consistency, and perseverance. Therefore, I never confine myself to a set role and always stay open to new ideas and challenges.",
    "about-2": "My journey in software engineering started with the goal of creating a hiking blog. As a result of my frustration with website builders, I committed myself to an immersive coding bootcamp to build the blog from scratch. Unexpectedly, my passion for it was ignited to the point that I wanted to make it my career. Having an emphasis on personal development, continuous learning, and a resilient mind, I believe that software engineering is the perfect fit for me.",
    "about-3": "Among my other passions, I enjoy learning languages and hiking the most. Language acts like a bridge which connects me to people and their cultures deeply. I am a fluent speaker of Mandarin, English and Cantonese and I acquired German and French to a conversational level during quarantine. As an avid hiker who enjoys sharing their experiences, my photograph was featured in local news after winning silver prize in a contest where hikers were invited to create a trail map for the community.",
    "about-4": "I’m currently seeking a full-time software engineer position. If you hire me, you’ll have a team player with strong problem-solving skills, a resilient spirit, and an open mindset. More about my skills and experiences can be found on my résumé."
